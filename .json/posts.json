The client, built with Angular, can be a web application, a native mobile application, or a desktop application. The client communicates with the server through an API, which is built with Express. The server then manages the requests with the MongoDB database.\n\nMEAN is a technology stack used for building full stack applications. It's a combination of the following technologies:\n\nMongoDB—document database\nExpress—a Node.js framework for building APIs\nAngular—front-end application framework\nNode.js—server-side JavaScript runtime environment\n\n## This Project covered\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll build a RESTful API that implements the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an product. For data persistence, we'll be using a MongoDB Atlas cluster.\n\nWe'll be building an product management web application. The interface will have the following pages:\n\n- View all Product\n- Add to Product\n- Order the Product (Realtime is not) and Track, generate invoices\n- Update existing Product and more\n\n_Home page_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-1.png)\n\n_Product Detail_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-2.png)\n\n_Cart Page_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-3.png)\n\n_Orders page_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-4.png)\n\n_Estimated Delivery_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-5.png)\n\n_Delivered page_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-6.png)\n\n_Download Invoice page_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-7.png)\n\n_View Invoice page_\n![alter-text](/images/post/post-8.png)\n\n[Live Demo](https://boat-web-application.vercel.app/dashboard)\n\n_Conclusion_\n\nThank you for joining me on this journey and following along! I hope you enjoyed it and learned a lot. The MEAN stack makes it easy to get started and to build scalable applications. You're using the same language throughout the stack: JavaScript. Additionally, MongoDB's document model makes it natural to map data to objects and MongoDB Atlas's forever-free cluster makes it easy to host your data without worrying about costs.\n","slug":"post-12"}]
