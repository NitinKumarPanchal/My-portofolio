Applications built with the MEAN stack follow the client-server architecture. The client, built with Angular, can be a web application, a native mobile application, or a desktop application. The client communicates with the server through an API, which is built with Express. The server then manages the requests with the MongoDB database.

MEAN is a technology stack used for building full stack applications. It's a combination of the following technologies:

MongoDB—document database
Express—a Node.js framework for building APIs
Angular—front-end application framework
Node.js—server-side JavaScript runtime environment

## This Project covered

In this tutorial, we'll build a RESTful API that implements the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an employee. For data persistence, we'll be using a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

We'll be building an employee management web application. The interface will have the following pages:

- View all Product
- Add to Product
- Order the Product (Realtime is not) and Track, generate invoices
- Update existing Product and more

_Conclusion_

Thank you for joining me on this journey and following along! I hope you enjoyed it and learned a lot. The MEAN stack makes it easy to get started and to build scalable applications. You're using the same language throughout the stack: JavaScript. Additionally, MongoDB's document model makes it natural to map data to objects and MongoDB Atlas's forever-free cluster makes it easy to host your data without worrying about costs.
