I'm a full stack developer with three years of experience in web development. I've worked on a variety of projects for clients in the retail, travel, and healthcare industries. I'm passionate about creating great user experiences and have a strong understanding of usability and accessibility standards. They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming to code a website's appearance, as well as taking care of debugging.
